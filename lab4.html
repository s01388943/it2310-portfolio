        <p>This is the first paragraph. It contains placeholder text for styling.</p> 

        <p> The paragraph sat there doing absolutely nothing, bravely committing to its role as a collection of words that neither informed nor entertained, quietly existing in a way that suggested purpose while carefully avoiding it. Each sentence wandered in without a plan, nodded politely at the idea of meaning, and then wandered right back out again, leaving behind a faint sense that something had almost happened but definitely didn’t </p>
