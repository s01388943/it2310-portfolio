    <h1>HI How are you</h1> 

    

    <p>This week, you'll build the foundation for everything we do this semester. You'll set up your development environment, create your first HTML page, establish your GitHub portfolio repository, and begin learning prompt engineering skills that will help you work effectively with AI tools throughout the course.</p> 

    

    <p>I'm excited to learn <strong>How to create my first HTML page</strong> this semester.</p>
