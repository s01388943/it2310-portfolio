    <h1>About Lab 2</h1> 

    <p>In this lab, I learned how to effectively create multi-page websites by using links and tables. I gained hands-on experience with relative paths to link pages within my own website, and absolute paths to link to external websites. This helped me understand the difference between linking locally and externally. Additionally, I learned the importance of making tables accessible by using the appropriate HTML attributes, which ensures that users with disabilities can navigate and understand the content. I also practiced committing changes to Git with descriptive messages, which improved my version control skills and helped me track the progress of my work more effectively. Overall, this lab gave me a deeper understanding of how to build websites that are both functional and accessible.
